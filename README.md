The major cities have large area to cover by different department.Thus their response time varies with the location.
If they have somegood predicted data about the incident happening , they could use the resource to solve the problem in efficient way.
To facilitate efficient resource allocation and management in cities, I propose a response time prediction system based on
Sparse Gaussian conditional random fields(GCRFs), that successfully captures the dependencies between historical and future response times. 
I propose to make a trained system which is able to accurately predict future response times one week in advance using just the
previous two weeks data at test.This requires low computational resources and data at test time, thus making it an attractive system
that can be readily deployed in practice.
